 *                       application again.

 *                       does not dereference this pointer.
 *
 * @returns
 *   Return the length of the report or -1 if the request is invalid.

 * 1. For known requests the callback should call
 *    @p usb_start_receive_ep0_data_stage() with a buffer to be filled with
 *    the report data and a callback which will get called when the data
 *    stage is complete.  The callback is required, and the data buffer
 *    passed to @p usb_start_receive_ep0_data_stage() must remain valid
 *    until the callback is called.
 *
 * It is worth noting that only one control transfer can be active at any
 * given time.  Once HID_SET_REPORT_CALLBACK() has been called, it will not
 * be called again until the next transfer, meaning that if the
 * application-provided HID_SET_REPORT_CALLBACK() function performs option 1
 * above, the callback function passed to @p
 * usb_start_receive_ep0_data_stage() will be called before any other setup
 * transfer can happen again.  Thus, it is safe to use the same buffer
 * for all control transfers if desired.
 *
 *
 * @param interface      The interface for which the report is provided
 * @param report_type    The type of report, either @p HID_INPUT,

 * @param report_id      The report index requested. This will be zero if the
 *                       device does not use numbered reports.
 * @returns
 *   Return 0 if the request can be handled or -1 if it cannot. Returning -1
 *   will cause STALL to be returned to the host.
